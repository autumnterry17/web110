	<p>Aerith Gainsborough is a playable character in Final Fantasy VII (FFVII). She is the healer of your team and one of the most important characters in the game. I discovered her a few years ago after seeing my sister play FFVII. I decided to play it as well, and I completely fell in love with her character.</p>
	
	<p>In the photo to the left, you can see my ever-growing collection of Aerith merchandise! I collect lots of figurines, cards, and toys so of course I had to collect Aerith as well! Collecting is one of my passions. Not only do I collect Aerith, I also draw her! I have dedicated many artworks to Aerith. Motivation to draw comes so much easier when it's one of my favorite characters.</p>
