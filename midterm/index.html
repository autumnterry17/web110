	<h2>Hello!</h2>
		
	<img src=me.jpg>
	
	<p>My name is Autumn Terry! I am 24 years old. I used to edit my Tumblr years ago using HTML, so I have a little personal experience! One of my favorite things ever is Final Fantasy VII, and my favorite character is Aerith. She is very important to me and has a huge impact on my life!♥</p>
	
	<p>I am mostly taking HTML out of interest, as it doesn't really relate to what I want to get a degree in. It is an interesting art, though! Speaking of art, I also draw! I usually do digital drawings but I also do traditional. There is so many interesting art forms out there even if they aren't commonly considered art!</p>
