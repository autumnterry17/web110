			<p>Final Fantasy is a series, but each game really isn't connected to one another. Each game has its own set of characters and its own world. The only thing that really links the games are the style, and sometimes the combat. But since combat styles in videogames and grown and changed over the years, so has Final Fantasy.</p>

		<div class="column2">
			<p>My favorite Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy 7 Remake! It, like the title implies, is a remake of the original Final Fantasy , which came out in 1997. The original is highly outdated now, which meant it was time for a remake. The graphics, gameplay, and characters all got major upgrades! Although the main storyline is the same. You play as Cloud Strife, a former SOLDIER who becomes a mercenary paid to work for an eco-terrorist organization. But this is just a small part of Final Fantasy 7's story, as so much more happens!</p>
